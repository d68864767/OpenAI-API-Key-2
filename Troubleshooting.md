## Error Codes

The OpenAI API returns standard HTTP status codes. Here are some of the most common ones you might encounter:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing parameter.
- `401 Unauthorized`: No valid API key provided.
- `403 Forbidden`: The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource couldn't be found.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: You're exceeding the rate limits.
- `500, 502, 503, 504 Server errors`: Something went wrong on OpenAI's end.

For a complete list of error codes, refer to the [API Documentation](APIDocumentation.md).

## Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter when using the OpenAI API:

- **Exceeding rate limits**: If you're making too many requests in a short period, you might hit the rate limits. Refer to the [Rate Limits](RateLimits.md) guide for more information.
- **Invalid API key**: Make sure you're using a valid API key. Check the [Authentication](Authentication.md) guide for more details.
- **Missing parameters**: Ensure all required parameters are included in your requests.

## Debugging Tips

Here are some tips to help you debug issues when using the OpenAI API:

- **Check the error message**: The API response includes an error message that can give you a clue about what went wrong.
- **Check your API key**: Make sure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
- **Check your request parameters**: Ensure all required parameters are included and are in the correct format.
- **Rate limits**: If you're getting a `429 Too Many Requests` error, you might be hitting the rate limits. Consider adding delays between your requests or increasing your rate limits.
