# Billing and Pricing

The OpenAI API uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model. This guide provides information on the billing and pricing for the OpenAI API Key.

## Overview

The cost of using the OpenAI API depends on the number of tokens processed by the API. A token can be as short as one character or as long as one word. For example, "ChatGPT is great!" is encoded into six tokens: ["Chat", "G", "PT", " is", " great", "!"].

The price per token depends on the type of user:

- Free trial users: Free within trial limits
- Pay-as-you-go users: $0.0005 per token

## Billing Period

Billing occurs monthly. At the end of each billing period, you will receive an invoice for the total number of tokens processed by the API during that period. The invoice will be sent to the email address associated with your OpenAI account.

## Payment Methods

OpenAI accepts the following payment methods:

- Credit Card
- Debit Card
- Bank Transfer

To add or change your payment method, go to your OpenAI account settings.

## Overages

If you exceed your token quota for the billing period, you will be charged for the additional tokens at the rate of $0.0005 per token.

## Free Trial

OpenAI offers a free trial for new users. The trial includes a certain number of free tokens. Any usage beyond the free token limit will be billed at the rate of $0.0005 per token.
