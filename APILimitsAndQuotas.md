# API Limits and Quotas

The OpenAI API has certain limits and quotas to ensure fair usage and protect the system from abuse. This guide provides information on the limits and quotas for the OpenAI API Key.

## Overview

The OpenAI API has the following limits and quotas:

- **Rate Limits**: The number of requests you can make per minute. This depends on the type of user (free trial, pay-as-you-go). For more details, refer to the [Rate Limits](RateLimits.md) guide.
- **Token Quota**: The number of tokens you can process per minute. This also depends on the type of user. Tokens are used to measure the amount of data processed by the API. For more details, refer to the [Billing and Pricing](BillingAndPricing.md) guide.
- **Concurrent Requests**: The number of requests you can make at the same time. This is set to 60 for all users.

## Headers

The API response includes the following headers that provide information about the limits and quotas:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests you can make per minute.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.

## Handling Limits and Quotas

If you exceed the limits and quotas, you should implement a backoff and retry strategy:

1. **Backoff**: Wait for some time before making the next request. The backoff time should increase exponentially with each consecutive rate limit error.
2. **Retry**: Retry the request after the backoff time.

Here is an example of how to handle limits and quotas in Python:

```python
import time
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

backoff_time = 1  # Start with a short backoff time
max_backoff_time = 120  # Don't wait for more than 2 minutes

while True:
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt="Hello, world!")
        print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
        backoff_time = 1  # Reset backoff time if request was successful
    except openai.Error as e:
        if e.status_code == 429:
            print(f"Rate limit exceeded, backing off for {backoff_time} seconds")
            time.sleep(backoff_time)
            backoff_time = min(backoff_time * 2, max_backoff_time)  # Double the backoff time for the next error
        else:
            raise e
```

Remember to replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual OpenAI API Key.

## Monitoring Usage

You can monitor your usage of the OpenAI API in your OpenAI account dashboard. The dashboard provides information on the number of requests made, tokens processed, and any rate limit errors.
