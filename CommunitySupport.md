## Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a popular platform for asking and answering programming questions. You can use the `openai-api` tag to find questions related to the OpenAI API Key. Remember to follow Stack Overflow's guidelines when asking or answering questions.

## GitHub Discussions

OpenAI also uses GitHub Discussions for community support. This is a good place to ask technical questions, especially if they are related to specific issues or bugs. You can also share your projects or ideas here.

Remember, when asking for help, provide as much information as possible about your issue, including the programming language you're using, the version of the OpenAI API Key, and any error messages you're seeing. This will make it easier for others to help you.
