## API Governance

API Governance involves the processes and policies that control and protect the API from misuse. It includes aspects such as:

- Ensuring the API is used in a way that complies with legal and regulatory requirements.
- Monitoring and controlling who has access to the API and how it is used.
- Ensuring the API is used in a way that aligns with the organization's strategic goals.

## Compliance

Compliance refers to the API's adherence to laws, regulations, and standards. This includes:

- Data protection and privacy laws, such as GDPR.
- Industry-specific regulations, such as HIPAA for healthcare data.
- Standards for data security and encryption.

It's important to understand the compliance requirements for your specific use case and ensure that your use of the API meets these requirements.
