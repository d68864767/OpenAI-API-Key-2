## Generating API Keys

When you sign up for an account with OpenAI, you will be provided with an API key. This key is used to authenticate your requests to the OpenAI API. To generate a new API key, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OpenAI account.
2. Navigate to the API Keys section.
3. Click on the 'Generate New Key' button.
4. Provide a name for the key and click 'Generate'.
5. Your new API key will be displayed. Be sure to save it in a secure location as you will not be able to view it again.

## Revoking API Keys

If you believe an API key has been compromised, or if you no longer need it, you can revoke it. To revoke an API key, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OpenAI account.
2. Navigate to the API Keys section.
3. Find the key you want to revoke and click on the 'Revoke' button.
4. Confirm your action.

## Regenerating API Keys

If you need to regenerate an API key, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Log in to your OpenAI account.
2. Navigate to the API Keys section.
3. Find the key you want to regenerate and click on the 'Regenerate' button.
4. Confirm your action.
5. Your new API key will be displayed. Be sure to save it in a secure location as you will not be able to view it again.

## Key Rotation

Regularly rotating your API keys is a good security practice. It minimizes the risk of keys being compromised and limits the potential damage if they are. A common practice is to rotate keys every 90 days.

## Key Storage

Never embed API keys directly in your code or check them into your source control. Instead, use secure environment variables or a secure key management system to store and access your keys.

Remember, API keys are sensitive information. Treat them like passwords and keep them secret.
